This is just a simple child learning for github.
Here I first created a branch.
Creating a file inside the child branch.
Then Commiting the changes.

After this Im going to merge this with the main branch.
Im supposed to create a pull request.
Since Im the creator of the current repository, Im also the administrator and Im gonna have the privilege to merge the pull request into the main branch.
